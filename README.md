# Shell_Script
Script for Basic Tasks in GNU/Linux
<br><br>
The script consists of an interactive menu that allows the user to choose between:

1) Checking system information, such as system name, GNU/Linux distribution used, Kernel version, and system architecture;
2) Checking if disk space usage is above or below 90%. If it is above, the 5 directories that are occupying the most disk space are listed;
3) Creation of users and addition to new groups or existing groups;
4) Mounting of devices/partitions based on the information provided by the user. If he informs a directory that does not yet exist, it is created;
5) Exit and any other options that the user types: options that display funny messages to the user.
<br><br>
- Some basic commands for content manipulation in the Linux environment were used, as well as administration and management of users and groups, system management, and Shell Script language.
- Code made in the VIM editor.
